/**
* @brief Fused multiply-add-add: y = x1 * x2 + x3 + x4, element-wise with NumPy broadcasting.

* @par Inputs:
* Four inputs, including:
* @li x1: A ND tensor. Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, int32.
* @li x2: A ND tensor. Must have the same dtype as x1; shape must be broadcastable with x1.
* @li x3: A ND tensor. Must have the same dtype as x1; shape must be broadcastable with (x1 * x2).
* @li x4: A ND tensor. Must have the same dtype as x1; shape must be broadcastable with (x1 * x2 + x3). \n

* @par Outputs:
* y: A ND tensor. Has the same dtype as x1; shape is the broadcast shape of x1, x2, x3 and x4. \n

* @par Third-party framework compatibility
* Compatible with the graph fusion of Mul followed by two Add operators
* (e.g. BatchMatmul + bias + residual patterns).
